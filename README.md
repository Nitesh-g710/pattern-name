# pattern-name
- Its a basic java code which takes a string as a input and return that string pattern but it takes only capital alphabets and also spaces.
- for example - i give input as "MY NAME IS NITESH" then it will print first word in 5 lines of pattern after printing 1st word it leaves 2 lines and take 2nd word print it in pattern then leave 2 lines.
- Same goes for whole String 

yet to implement:-
- exception is not implemented
- if try to give smallercase letter, special character, number as an input then program will get terminated.
